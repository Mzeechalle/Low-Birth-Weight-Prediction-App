# Low-Birth-Weight-Prediction-app

This is a machine learning app to predict if the birth weight of the baby is low or normal.

Keep in mind that, whether a baby is born premature or at term (on time) but didn't grow enough during pregnancy, they can be classified as a low birth weight (LBW) baby, i.e., A LBW baby weighs less than 2500 grams, or 5 lbs, 5 oz.

This project is based on the 2022 Tanzania Demographic Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey (TDHS-MIS), which is freely accessible online. We now have employ machine learning techniques to help identify if the weight of the baby at birth is low or normal. 

This is because, the LBW infants who survive infancy are at increased risk of long-term consequences such as neurodevelopmental problems, stunting, respiratory disorders, lower IQ, and adult-onset chronic diseases. Additionally, when LBW girls become mothers, they are more likely to deliver LBW infants themselves.

# Streamlit Cloud

The application is an ongoing process to be deployed in the Streamlit Cloud. The link to access will be made available when ready
